		<h1 class="name">MOON</h1>
		<p class="inf">The Moon is Earth's only proper natural satellite. At one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),[13] it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall (larger than any dwarf planet).</p>

	<div class="about-earth">
		<h1 class="name">EARTH</h1>
		<p class="inf">Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.
		Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.</p>

	<div class="about-mars">
		<h1 class="name">MARS</h1>
		<p class="inf">Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.</p>
